== 示例拆分和聚合异步流程

此示例基于 link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/splitter-flow-control-reference#basic-splitter-example[Splitter基本示例]。按照以下步骤在异步流程中运行消息片段，然后将其聚合回单条消息。

....

. Drag a *VM connector* to the end of the flow.
+
. Drag a second VM connector outside the existing flow, below it. This creates a new flow.
. Drag the existing aggregator and logger you had in the first flow to the new second flow, after the VM connector.
+
image:splitter+flow+3.png[splitter+flow+3]
+
. Configure the two VM connectors. Change both their *Queue Path* to `step2`.
+
image:vm4.png[vm4]
+
After you configure both VMs with the same *Queue Path*, they are linked. Messages that arrive to the first VM continue their path out of the second VM.
+
What you have at this point appears to work identically to what you built in the first example. There is, however, one key difference: each fraction of the message is processed simultaneously rather than in sequence. If you deploy your app to a cluster of servers, this has a big effect on performance.

You should see four messages logged into the console: the first three should be short, one for every "actor" XML element (notice the ID attribute in each message). After these first three messages there should be a fourth, longer message, which is logged after the aggregator has run. Notice two things:

* Although the aggregator was triggered three times, once for every fraction of the message that reached it, it produced one single output message, only when all of the fractions were in place
* The aggregator assembles the message in the order in which fractions have arrived; the final message may be shuffled. If maintaining the original sequence is important to you, take a look at the Advanced Example 2 in this page.

== Example Reordering Before Aggregating

This example builds upon the previous example.

If fractions of the message are being processed in parallel in different servers, there's a good chance that they may take different lengths of time to be processed, and consequently fall out of order. The following example solves that problem.

Follow the steps below to:

* Run message fragments in asynchronous flows.
* Arrange them back into the original sequence.
* Aggregate them back into a single message that follows the original sequence.

....

. Add a *Resequencer* Flow Control before the aggregator
+
image:splitter+flow+5.png[splitter+flow+5] +
+
The Resequencer waits for all of the messages in the group to arrive (keeping track of MULE_CORRELATION_ID and MULE_CORRELATION_GROUP_SIZE) and then reorder them according to their MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE index.
+
The Resequencer outputs three distinct messages, so the Aggregator is still needed to merge them into one.
. Run the Mule project.

With the Resequencer in place, messages now reach the aggregator in the correct order and are assembled accordingly.

To really take advantage of splitting the message, you should deploy your app to a cluster of servers. By following the steps below, you can simulate the random delays of a cluster of servers.

[CAUTION]
--
The following is not an implementable solution but rather a proof of concept that highlights what occurs in the flow.

. Add a *Groovy component* in the second flow, between the VM and the logger. 
+
image:splitter+flow+6.png[splitter+flow+6]
+
. Copy the following code into the Groovy Component:
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
random = new Random()
randomInt = random.nextInt(10)*1000
Thread.sleep(randomInt)
return payload
----
+
This snippet of code simply introduces a random delay of up to 10 seconds. As each message is running asynchronously, this delay can potentially alter the order in which messages move on to the next step, simulating what could happen in a real implementation with parallel servers processing each fraction of the message.

<scripting:component doc:name="Groovy">
    <scripting:script engine="Groovy">
        <![CDATA[
            random = new Random()
            randomInt = random.nextInt(10)*1000
            Thread.sleep(randomInt)
            return payload

....
------

Run the project. 

You should now see three messages logged into the console, one for every "actor" XML element. These likely not have their MULE_CORRELATION_SEQUENCE indexes in order due to the random delays caused by the Groovy code.

Below these, you see a fourth longer message where these indexes are put back in order by the Resequencer.
