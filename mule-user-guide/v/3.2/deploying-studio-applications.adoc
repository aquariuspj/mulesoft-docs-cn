= 部署Studio应用程序

在Mule Studio中开发的项目可以在与Studio捆绑的Mule CE服务器上本地运行，导出为在Mule EE服务器上运行，或者使用Mule iON部署到云端。

== 存档项目

Studio允许您以zip格式（Mule Deployable Archive）保存项目，其中包含Mule Studio元数据。这种打包的Mule存档为在Studio版本之间传输文件或备份Studio项目提供了便利的方法。压缩包中包含特定于项目的所有信息，包括流程，配置文件，Java类，引用的HTML文件等。

=== 打包Mule Deployable Archive

要导出Studio项目的Mule Deployable存档，请完成以下指示信息：

. 右键单击*Package Explorer*窗格中的项目名称，然后选择*Export*。或者，点击*Package Explorer*中的项目名称，然后从*File*菜单中选择*Export*。 +
 
+
image:export1.png[EXPORT1] +
+

 +
. 在*Export*窗格中，单击*Mule*打开或展开关联的节点（如果尚未打开），选择*Mule Studio Project to Mule Deployable Archive*，然后单击{{4} }。 +
 
+
image:export2.png[export2] +
+

 +
. 选择要将项目存档保存到的输出文件夹，然后单击*Finish*。 +
 
+

+

 +

=== 导入一个Mule Deployable Archive

如果从Studio中导出Mule Deployable Archive，则归档中包含的Studio特定元数据将恢复到Studio中。

要将Mule Deployable Archive导入Studio，请完成以下步骤：

. 右键单击*Package Explorer*窗格，然后选择*Import*。或者，从*File*菜单中选择*Import*。 +
 
+
image:import1a.png[import1a] +
+

 +
. 在*Import*对话框中，选择*Mule Studio generated Deployable Archive*，然后点击*Next*。 +
 
+
image:import1.png[import1] +
+

 +
. 在*Zip File*字段中，选择项目归档的zip文件，然后点击*Finish*。您也可以更改*Project Name*，并从下拉列表中选择*Server Runtime*，该列表被设置为默认的`Mule CE 3.2.1.` +
 
+
image:import2b.png[import2b] +
+

 +

片刻之后，导入的项目将显示在您指定的项目名称下的Package Explorer视图中。

== 在Mule Studio中运行项目

Mule Studio简化了运行你的Mule项目的过程。当您指定*Run as a Mule Application*时，您的项目会自动构建并部署到内部Mule服务器，如有必要，该服务器将自动启动。

完成这些步骤在Mule Studio中运行您的项目：

. 打开项目名称下`/src/main/resources`节点下的`flow`节点，找到*Package Explorer*中项目流的引用。 `flow`节点包含您的流名称，后跟`mflow`扩展名。
. 右键单击流（`SpellChecker.mflow`），从上下文菜单中选择*Run As*，然后从上下文菜单中选择*Mule Application*。 +
 
+

+

 +

您的项目部署到与Studio捆绑在一起的内部Mule服务器。 Studio控制台显示有关构建和部署过程的详细信息。当控制台显示以下行时，您的项目将部署到Mule ESB并运行：

[source,java]

=== Re-Running Your Project

After running your project, you can quickly re-launch it without repeating the above steps. If your flow is open in the Message Flow canvas, and you previously ran it as a Mule Application, you can relaunch it simply by clicking the *Run* icon, which is located in the *Launch* group on the Studio toolbar.

If your flow is not currently open in the Message Flow canvas, click the drop-down arrow next to the *Run* icon, then select your project from the list. This causes Studio to deploy and run the selected project.

=== Stopping Your Project

A deployed project continues to run until you exit Studio or manually stop the project. To manually halt a running project, click the *Terminate* icon above the Console pane.

== Run Your Project on a Mule server

Your Mule Studio project is fully deployable to both Mule CE and EE. Complete these steps to download, install, and run your project:

=== Download and Install Mule

If you do not already have Mule ESB installed, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/complete-installation-manual[Mule Installation] manual.

=== Start Mule

To launch Mule:

. Open a command window or terminal window.
. Navigate to the `/bin` directory where Mule is installed.
. Type: `./mule` (or `.\mule` on Windows).
. To stop Mule, enter: `Ctrl-C`.

=== Deploy Your Mule Studio Application

. Export your Mule Studio project to a deployable archive, as detailed above. This produces a file with a `zip` extension.
. Copy this file into the `/app` directory where Mule ESB was installed.
. Mule ESB automatically extracts your archive and deploys your application. You can view progress in the command (or terminal) window. If no errors are found, the window displays a "Started app" message. Also note that your application is unarchived or extracted in the `app` directory.
. If you wish to undeploy your application but keep Mule ESB running, navigate to the `/app` directory and delete the file `YourProjectName-anchor.txt`. This removes your project from the `/app` directory.

== Launching Projects on Mule iON

Mule iON is a cloud-based integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS). It provides a convenient way for developers to launch their applications on a cloud platform, while also providing many enhanced features for solving cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-premise integration problems. Mule Studio is fully integrated with Mule iON and facilitates simple application deployment.

The following steps detail:

* setting up a Mule iON account
* deploying your Mule application to iON through Studio dialogs.

=== Create a Mule iON Account

Developers can obtain a Mule iON account free of charge for six months. You are limited to one "worker" during this period. Additional resources can be purchased at any time.

. If you have a Mule community account, you simply log into Mule iON with your credentials.
. Log in to the Mule iON interface. First time users are directed to the New Application interface where applications can be deployed to Mule iON.

For this example, however, we deploy our application directly from Studio by completing the following steps.

=== Adapt Your Project for Mule iON if Needed

Many projects can be deployed directly to Mule iON. However, some projects require minor modifications, as summarized below:

. If you are deploying a project that listens on a static port, you need to change the port to a dynamic value so that Mule iON can set it at deployment time. To do so, change your port values to `${http.port`}. You can create an `application.properties` file that allows you to run your project locally on a specific port and also on Mule iON as a dynamic port. See the example [Build Your First Project with Mule Studio] for details on how to create this file.
. The Studio JDBC and FTP components are currently not supported by Mule iON. The EE versions of these components are supported by Mule iON, however.
. If using the Jetty component, set the host to 0.0.0.0 and not to localhost.

=== Deploy Your Project to Mule iON

. In Mule Studio, right-click your flow in the `flow` node under the `src/main/resources` node in the Package Explorer view. Select *Mule iON* from the window that opens, and then *Deploy to iON...* from the new window that cascades open. +
 
+

+

 +
. Enter your credentials, then choose a domain in which to deploy your application. The value you enter must be a unique sub-domain which is created for your application on the muleion.com domain such as, `http://Your-Project-Name.muleion.com`.
. Click on *Check Availability* to confirm that the domain is available.
. Choose *1 Worker* if you are a new user with a free account. Paying users may wish to assign additional resources to their application; however, this can be done later through the iON web interface. You may also enter an optional description.
. Click *Finish* to deploy your application to iON. +

+

 +
. After a few moments, if your project deploys successfully, the following response appears: +
 
+

+

 +

=== Inspect Your Application in the Mule iON Web Interface

To check your application's deployment status, login to your Mule iON account.

After logging in, you are directed to the dashboard. If your application is deployed, a green icon will appear next to your application name in the upper corner of the dashboard.

You can access your running application at the displayed URL, which is based on the sub-domain you specified when deploying your application.

== Debugging Your Application

Mule Studio is an Eclipse plugin ( http://www.eclipse.org/[www.eclipse.org]) that incorporates all Eclipse debugging features.

A Debug perspective lets you manage the debugging or running of a program in the Workbench.

You can control the execution of your program by setting breakpoints, suspending launched programs, stepping through your code, or examining the contents of variables.

These debugging features apply to Java, JavaScript, and other languages that you may use within Mule Studio to build Mule applications.

Please see the http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/[Eclipse documentation] for more information on these features.
