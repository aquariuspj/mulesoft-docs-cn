= Example: Basic Migration to Mule 4

This example migrates a simple Mule app to Mule 4 from Mule 3.

TODO: SUGGESTIONS FOR THE EXAMPLE FROM ALLEVA:

* could be a proxy example, perhaps with stuff like this:
    * listener
    * requester
    * easy batch?
    * something working with files or ftp
    * data transformation use case, ETL process
    * basic error handler

// Writer: Please explain the features or use cases you are going
// to cover, explaining how they worked in Mule 3 vs. how they
// work in Mule 4.

// You might list features in Mule 3 that you migrate to Mule 4,
// naming each feature, explaining how things changed in Mule 4,
// and anything about how it will work once migrated.

// * Feature 1
// * Feature 2
// * Feature etc.

// Before and After description: Please provide the big picture of what
// the app you are migrating looks like. Screenshots from in Studio 6 vs. // Studio 7 might be the most straightforward way to illustrate this.

//Optional: screenshot to store in migration/_images
Here is a screenshot of this Mule app in Studio 6:

// including any prep, for example:

This migration follows these basic steps:

. step 1
. step 2
. etc.

// Break down the app migration on a feature-by-feature basis.
