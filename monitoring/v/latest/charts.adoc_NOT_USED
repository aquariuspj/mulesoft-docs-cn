TODO - EXTRA/SUPPORTING

User story
When adding resources and metrics to charts I need to be able to define a visual representation for the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable values for the added metrics so that in the future I can easily make sense of spikes and quickly decide which  spike is outside the area of acceptable values so that I can focus on a real issue.

Supporting feature
Allowing the user to add thresholds when configuring charts
