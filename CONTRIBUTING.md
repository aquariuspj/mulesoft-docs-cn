# Community Contributions

MuleSoft welcomes contributions from the community! You can contribute or provide feedback for our documentation in the following ways:

* Fork this repository, make edits, and then submit a pull request. We will respond to your request as quickly as possible.
* File an issue. Please be as specific as possible about the changes you'd like to see.
* While viewing a page on our [docs site](https://docs.mulesoft.com), you can rate a specific topic and include comments for fixes, suggestions, or general feedback.
* Send mail to the docs team: docs_team@mulesoft.com

## Accepting the Contributor's Agreement

Before you can contribute to our documentation, you need to complete two steps to acknowledge that you've read and accepted our Contributor's Agreement:

. Review the agreement, which is [available here](http://www.mulesoft.org/legal/contributor-agreement.html).
. After you've read and agree to the agreement, you need to fill out the [MuleSoft Contributor's Agreement](https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/notebooks/#d28e8f95e739ee1e1e30d5ec577f4a27) form and submit it to us. This form exists as an API notebook and does two things:
* Identifies you using your GitHub account, and
* Records your name as a contributor

After you've submitted the form, you will be asked to authenticate to GitHub and accept our Contributor's Agreement. When the script has been completed, an Issue is created in our contributor's project with your name.

That's it! You're now able to make contributions to our documentation. Ready to get started?

## Making a Contribution

After you've accepted our Contributor's Agreement, you can simply fork our documentation repository and make changes, then submit a pull request. The pull request will be reviewed by our team as soon as possible.
